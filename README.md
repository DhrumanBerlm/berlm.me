# berlm.me
A website where I post articles and updates on my portfolio.

## What it means, and why
I've always wanted to have, or at least- make a website for myself (an actual good one), where I can post things I like, have a portfolio page, maybe write some articles on things I like, or even tutorials/introductions into technical problems I see in many places (Serialization, Networking, etc.).  

In a way, this is a thing to cross off from my bucket list.

## Techincal Information
- **Frontend**: React.js. Static build files are passed from here to the backend's file provider.
- **In-Memory Database**: Redis
- **DevOps**: Netlify Auto deploy

## Development Roadmap/Todo List
I have a public trello list on which I keep adding TODO things (as they come in my mind). The status of the features can be seen there as well.
